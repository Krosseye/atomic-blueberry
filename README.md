## Installation Options

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> AMD and Intel users should use `ghcr.io/krosseye/atomic-blueberry`, and Nvidia users should use `ghcr.io/krosseye/atomic-blueberry-nvidia`

### Rebase

> [!WARNING]  
> **[This is an experimental feature](https://www.fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/OstreeNativeContainerStable), try at your own discretion.**

To rebase an existing atomic Fedora installation to the latest build of Atomic Blueberry:

1. Install the unsigned image to update keys and policies:

```bash
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/krosseye/atomic-blueberry:latest
systemctl reboot
```

2. Complete the rebase with the signed image:

```bash
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/krosseye/atomic-blueberry:latest
systemctl reboot
```

### ISO

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Pre-built ISOs are currently not available, this is planned for the future.**

If built on Fedora Atomic, you can generate an offline ISO with the instructions available [here](https://blue-build.org/learn/universal-blue/#fresh-install-from-an-iso).

## Verification

These images are signed with [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/)'s [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign). You can verify the signature by downloading the `cosign.pub` file from this repo and running the following command:

```bash
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/krosseye/atomic-blueberry
```
